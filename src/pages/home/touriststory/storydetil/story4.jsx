In my whole Sylhet tour, I was guided by Alamgir Bhai (Driver). It’s a pleasure to mention him here because he nicely guided and helped me to know a lot about Sylhet. This is what I love about solo travel. You’ll meet new people on the road. Furthermore, will learn something new from them.

Moreover, my five days itinerary will help you to plan your tour in Sylhet either solo or a group.

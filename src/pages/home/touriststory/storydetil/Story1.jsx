            Sundarban tour is one of the memorable tours of my whole life. I am a passionate traveler. Traveling is my love, passion, dream, and my life. I always travel alone. Because alone travel makes a chance to intimate with nature. Last winter I travel to the Sundarbans for 3days and 2 nights. Every time I had a routine work before the tour. My diary, camera, tripod, tent, coffee maker, pen, hat, water bottle, map, luggage, and my lovely smartphone.

Sundarban is the biggest mangrove forest in the world and also a very safe place for tourists. Because bdr is always made a safety protocol for every tourist team. If you are a newcomer from another country then just arrive at Dhaka airport get some snacks to take refreshments and chose your way to Khulna by road or plane. If you choose by road the direct reached in Khulna but by plane, you arrive in Jessore then come Khulna by road but it’s a very easy way to come here. if you want another way then book a package from Dhaka to Sundarbans tour by ship. or select Bangladesh parjatan corporation package tour. But I suggest you, at the first book a package for Sundarbans tour plan with any reputed tourist planner team.  

Our journey starts from Khulna BIW ghat night at 10 pm with a lovely and beautiful ship. Our ship arrives in Kotka at 4 am. Sometime later the sun rises in the east from deep-sea with the purple caller. This moment was so beautiful I have ever seen. Huge known and unknown birds have surrounded us. We feel the pure and fresh air in our lunch. Some boatmen are wake up and starting fishing in the river. The river has fulfilled by huge fish, crab, snake, crocodile, etc.

Sometime later we finished our breakfast and land into Kotka, this time our destination is Kotka sea beach. We started walking to the beach, but this was not an ordinary way to walk. Our way surrounded by small, medium, big Sundari, geua, and name unknown tree, grass, golpata tree a small wood bridge a pond which pond water drink deer, monkey, pig, porcupine, and royal Bengal tiger. Sundori tree and royal Bengal tiger are the pride for Sundarbans mangrove forest. We cross 4/5 km path with joyful discussion with travel mate and forest officer. The officer shares some historic story with us from his job life in this jungle. Kotka sea beach is not a long beach, but it makes me surprised. I have seen 8/10 see the beach before that but this place is uncommon from others. Especially, the combination of beach and forest tree. This time I select my place for camping. This is the best place ever for entertaining camping. We all complete our bath in the sea with joy. The big wave finished our all travel stress and filled our minds with love and peace. Around two hours we swim, play football, etc.

We back to ship and finished our lunch with some delicious local river fish and beef biryani with salad. After taking some rest we started side seeing and get a grand reception from some wild animal. Here have present a huge amount of monkey, pig, porcupine, and minimum more than a thousand plus wild and beautiful deer. The deer is not afraid of our presence. They walk, running, play, and take food normally they have got. It was an unforgettable afternoon in my entire life. Thousands of deer around us but here is a big risk, anytime tiger is coming for finding food. Because of tiger-like deer as food.

We finished our day with a beautiful sunset. The time we spent was awesome. We back again our ship and quickly take preparation for camping. Take my bag Pac and started walking for my dream camping with my favorite snacks. I started camping alone but sometime later Rakib and Anika joined with me. They are both coming from Dhaka University.

Luckily that night was fully by huge moonlight. We arranged a bbq party with drinks. Wild waves are roaring in the sea apart and the other side is different, nature is fully by silence with increase full moonlight. That cosmic scene is never forgettable. When I campaign with nature every time have seen an uncommon event. The night is going to deep with a changeable mind-blowing nature. And I am the only one eye witness for those events. Because Rakib & Anika going to sleep 2 hours ago. The sun rises in the east with purple beauty like yesterday.  

Today our destination is dublar chor. This island is located in the Bay of Bengal. The island size is 15 km Population is not calculated but not much more. it’s surrounded by a deep blue sea. And have a beautiful sea beach. It was more than beautiful from Kotka beach. But all information is collected from general people. Now at noon and we all are waiting for land on the beautiful island. Sometimes later we see a small sign from long distance from the ship. Very slowly the island is fully visible with the right size and shape. And blowing my mind at a glance. One by one we arrive on the island and quickly running to the amazing beach. Finished some side seeing we found the only one local market around 2/3 km from our ship. Here have tea stall, barbershop, departmental store, mobile shop, and everything necessary, especially one thing is here that is the dry fish market. One of the very popular markets in the hole country. Bangladesh has two biggest dry fish market, this is one of them. Tangra, lotki, parshe, vetki, shrimp, datne, and huge kind of dry fish have produced here and supplied for all Bangladesh. I bought some lotki and shrimp for my family & others.

We take some rest in a tea stall with hot and testy tea, especially this tea is made by the uncommon local recipe but enough testy. Then all take a joyful bath in the blue sea and generate more power and strength. Later we back to ship and take lunch with beef curry, polaw, crunchy & tasty local sea fish. And go back home with some unforgettable memory.

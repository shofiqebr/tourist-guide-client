            A lovely day today! It’s amazing how short a distance you need travel from Dhaka to be transported to the relative peace and quiet of rural Bangladesh. The destination of today’s day-trip, with a fellow volunteer, was the ancient city of Sonargaon (‘Golden Town’ in Hindi), 25km southeast of the city, in the Narayanganj district, of the Dhaka division (see post 8 pt. 13). A bus journey from Gulistan station took us to Mograpara, the departure point for the sights that make up the scattered remnants of Old Sonargaon.

Today, very little remains of what was once a thriving port city,  accessible from the Meghna River, and, at its zenith, a centre of culture and commerce. Furthermore, it is very difficult to get a clear picture of the history of the area, particularly in relation to the specifics of the remaining historical ruins. Guide books are vague: Internet searches quickly lead to the now familiar Bangladeshi quagmire of contradictory information, with much plagiarism between sites. Of course there is the added complication that I am looking for information in English.

Nevertheless, despite not having reliable knowledge, I certainly got a feel for the grand past of this area through the many decaying remnants of an impressive built heritage. It was astonishing and thrilling to suddenly come upon a ruin from pre-Mughal times, or a crumbling mansion from the British Raj era, while travelling slowly by rickshaw through serene, bucolic countryside.

Sonargaon in medieval times

The few surviving remnants of Sonargaon are scattered along quiet country roads, on both sides of the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway. As far as I can make out, Sonargaon, as a medieval town, had importance as a Hindu capital, before becoming an Islamic capital and the seat of an independent sultanate in Bengal. I have read that observations from an envoy of the Chinese Emperor in 1406 attested to its prosperity: it was described as a walled city with wide boulevards, great bazaars and majestic mausoleums. Later (1588), the merchant and chronicler Ralph Fitch wrote of its importance as a centre for the manufacture of superior quality, indigo-dyed, fine muslin. (Incidentally, this muslin forms the base for the beautiful, woven jamdani fabric, for which Dhaka was famous during the Mughal period, a tradition that continues today.) After the Mughals conquered Bengal, they moved their capital to Dhaka in 1608, thus inaugurating Sonargaon’s long, slow decline.

Quaint pre-Mughal bridges and ghosts of the East India Company

Our rickshaw-puller had to negotiate a few bridges that were shaped like inverted ‘U’s: mind you, we stepped out for the uphill bits! One in particular was marked on a map in my guidebook. This was the picturesque, pre-Mughal, three-arched, brick-built Dullalapur Bridge. I found a photo of this bridge, taken in 1872,  in the British Library online gallery, and have included it (together with others from that time of the sights I saw today) in the selection below. All are attributed to a ‘W. Brennand’, about whom I’ve been unable to find any information.

Near this bridge, we visited Nil Kuthi (literally ‘blue house’), once an indigo factory and trading house built by the British East India Company. Indigo dye was one of the main products traded by the Company. I have been interested in natural dyes for some time now, and so it was exciting to visit this house and find out a little more about indigo. However, the story of indigo in Bengal is not a happy one. I have read that the industry was associated so closely with oppression and coercion, that it led District Magistrate E. W. L. Tower to testify before the Indigo Commission in 1860 that, ‘not a chest of indigo reached England without being stained with human blood’. After half a century of subjugation, there were a number of mutinies in Bengal, the most well-known of which is the bloody Indigo Revolt of 1859-61. In 1860, the playwright Dinabandhu Mitra wrote the revolutionary drama Nil Darpan (Indigo Mirror). Because of its anti-British portrayal of colonial planters’ exploitation of Indian peasants, it was translated anonymously by the great Bengali writer, Michael Madhusadan Dutt. (For more on Dutt see post 34.) For those who are interested, you can read the full play here. To this day, older farmers in Bangladesh are uncomfortable about indigo production. However, today in Sonargaon, apart from its name and my imaginings of times past, there is no evidence of the indigo industry at Nil Kuthi. It is a collection of stone buildings, around a courtyard, housing local families.

Mosques and tombs and a medieval centre of learning

We saw quite a few historical, interesting mosques which you can see in the photograph selection below:

The small, enclosed, square-type, single-domed Goaldi Mosque, built in 1519 by Mulla Hizabar Akbar Khan, and since restored.
The mosque and tombs of Panch Pir (Panch=5; Pir=Holy man). The British Library catalogue, drawing on a tour report of Bengal and Bihar in 1878-80, states that nothing is known about the holy men buried in the five tombs here, but that they were venerated throughout Bengal. I couldn’t find a reliable date anywhere for the mosque, but it is still in use. Since we visited on a Friday, there were many men in attendance at prayers.
The distinctive red-domed mosque of the saint Pir Muhammad Yusuf, dating to 1700, and a nearby tombs complex. Again, this mosque is still in use. The British Library surmises that it was probably erected by Pir Muhammad Yusuf, and the tombs of the saint and his family are in the adjacent complex. Some of the tombs are housed in roofed huts in the distinctive ‘bengali’ architectural style.
